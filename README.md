# 🫂 Welfare

**Welfare** is a staff-focused community support platform built for **schools**, **colleges**, and **institutions**. It enables staff members to contribute funds monthly into welfare groups, and support one another during important life events such as **childbirth**, **bereavement**, or **marriage**.

Each group operates independently using a **multi-tenancy architecture**, allowing each institution or department to manage its welfare activities separately and securely.
